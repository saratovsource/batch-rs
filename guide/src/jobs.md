# Jobs

## Declaring a job

The simplest way to declare a job is to create a function, and then annotate it with Batch's [`job`] procedural macro:

```rust
use batch::job;

#[job(name = "batch-example.say-hello")]
fn say_hello(name: String) {
	println!("Hello {}!", name);
}
```

## Return value of a job

As of today, the [`job`] macro only supports two types of return values:

* either the function return a unit value (the `()` type);
* either the function return a value that implements the [`IntoFuture`] trait (amongst others, it is implemented for `Future` and `Result`)

The macro not being capable of determining whether the function complies with the above requirements means that if you made a mistake, the compiler will error and the message might not be the clearest, so keep that in mind if you encounter a compile error on one of your job.

## Injecting external values

More often than not, your job will need values that can't or shouldn't be transfered in their message payload. For example, you might need a connection handle to your database, or a mail API client instance, or even the contents of a configuration file. To solve this problem, Batch allow you to mark arguments as "injected". This is done by using the `inject` parameter of the `job` attribute:

```rust
use batch::job;

#[job(name = "batch-example.send-hello", inject = [ repository, mailer ])]
fn send_hello(user_id: i32, repository: UserRepository, mailer: Mailer) {
	...
}
```

In the example above, Batch will only put the `user_id` parameter in the underlying structure, and will fetch the values for the `repository` and the `mailer` values when performing the job. These values are registered on the executor of the job which more often than not will be Batch's own [`Worker`].

---

## Under the hood

Annotating a function with the [`job`] procedural macro will do two things:

* Create a new structure deriving Serde's [`Serialize`] & [`Deserialize`] traits, that stores all of the *non-managed* (see below) function arguments. This implies that all of the arguments must also implement Serde's [`Serialize`] & [`Deserialize`] traits. More importantly, this new structure also implements Batch's [`Job`] trait.
* Change the annotated function to return an instance of the newly defined structure (see previous bullet point), allowing for easy scheduling of the job.

## Get or set the underlying struct of a job

When invoked, [`job`] procedural macro will generate a new structure declaration containing the arguments for the job, and implementing the [`Job`] trait. The name of this structure is generated using the name of the function and transform it to Pascal Case, which for our first example would give:

```rust
use batch::job;

#[job(name = "batch-example.say-hello")]
fn say_hello(name: String) {
	// ...
}

// Would generate:

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct SayHello {
	name: String
}

impl batch::Job for SayHello {
	// ...
}
```

However, this simple naming scheme can sometimes conflict with already existing code. To overcome this problem, Batch allows you to set the name of the structure that will be generated, by using the `wrapper` parameter:

```rust
use batch::job;

#[job(name = "batch-example.say-hello", wrapper = MySuperAwesomeJob)]
fn say_hello(name: String) {
	// ...
}

// Would generate:

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MySuperAwesomeJob {
	name: String
}

impl batch::Job for MySuperAwesomeJob {
	// ...
}
```
